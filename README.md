# A-Simple-Calculator
A Simple Basic Calculator for arithematical applications.
It's asimple calculator, "performs basic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Percentage and Clear". Ever since, tedious mathematical problems in the organization is not a simple one, that is to say, the process can be said to involve a lot of procedures or protocols which ranges from insertion of figures for tedious calculation, procesing of numbers and retrivl of errors. However, because of this , there is the need to accumplish an extensive research to discover the intriccacies involved in the entire process. So implementation of a simle basiccalculator is a good idea which i got. A simple basic calculator is something referred to as a four-function calculator.It's able to do simple arithmatic operations which includes addition,subtractin,multiplication and division as i mentioned above. This will allow students to solve "complecated problems", "quickly" and in an "efficient manner". Additionally, "it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks" and "allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem." Here we are using VS Code editor and Programmed in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It's a web that will pop out when we run the code.There we have some numericals from 0-9 and basic arithematical operators like +, - , * , / and % . 1. "+" : Addition 2. "-" : Subtraction 3. "*" : Multiplication 4."/" : Division 5. "%" : Percentage 6. "C" : Clear all input to the calculator 7. "CE" : Clear most recent entry
